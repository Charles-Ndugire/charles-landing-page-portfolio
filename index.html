I have graduated from the JKUAT with a degree in Mathematics and computer science in the year 2016. I majored in pure mathemaicts and  I have enthusiastically been interested  studying programming, not only in school, but also via Internet.

This is when I came across <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"><em>Moringa School</em></a> and decided to take on their curse to pursue Software engineering and scale-up my skills towards becoming a world class Software developer.
